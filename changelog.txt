Previous Versions:

Version 1.1
- Updated stats on all minister and leader pads for all 5 clans.  Changed tooltip colours for these to blue to reflect the improved stats.
- Updated stats on Berserk Armor (Both Rental Berserk Armor and 'Armor' Berserk Armor)
- Updated stats on Critical Striker
- Updated Boundless Fist set effects (this is in actually in setitem.bin and not map.bin, but they will be distributed together)
- Corrected spelling of all 'Viscious Saber' to 'Vicious Saber'
- Edited Universal Amulet to show the hidden stats
- Added the CIB precomped rental weapons back to the file (these seemed to be aborted, so I didn't add them previously)
- Edited the # of entries value at the top of the file.  I'm not sure if this makes a difference or not, it needs testing with a char with a 
minister spot (the last entries in the file are clan upgrades).  My hunch is that if the value is too low, it doesn't process the rest of the entries 
once it hits that number.  The problem is, does anything happen if the number is too high?  I'm not counting every entry to see if it's correct.

Version 1.02
This version was/is available for download on my forum in the news post on RSK stat changes, but it seems like 
nobody downloaded it.
- Corrected the Persian Armor tooltip to have the correct stats
- Updated Razing Storm Kick stats to the new stats
- Changed Claw Bracer and Claw Bracer Demo icons to the real claw bracer icon (WCB not changed, although it has the same icon).

Version 1.01
Privately Released.
- Added the effect descriptions of CIB created items in evaluate.  I forgot this in the first version I made.

Version 1.0
This is the version that was on the main pso/fwo site as a manual patch.  It adds back most of the CIB created items 
that were missing from the version that came with 1.3.
